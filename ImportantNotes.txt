1. Run this to make sure node is building successfully. Otherwise deployment will fail even though it runs fine locally.
node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --config webpack.config.vendor.js --env.prod

2. Why am I using EF model classes directly to send data to the front end?
Without doing so, I will have to recreate all query results by converting each object in a 
collection to the new type. It will make all queries slower for the benefit of only few 
queries where the extra layer of new types add value.
